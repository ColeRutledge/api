javascript developer,"New York, NY",WordPress Developer & Admin for EdTech Startup Employee,"New York, NY",Smart Course,Up to $65 an hour,Just posted,"We're currently recruiting for our socially impactful EdTech/Healthcare startup: Smart Course (https://smartcourse.io)
We're also hosting our second ADHD in Middle School Summit (https://smartcourse.io/aims), which is a 5-day online event with over 40 world-class speakers, all of them highly renowned in the field of ADHD.
Dr. Edward Hallowell
Dr. William Dodson
Dr. Ross Greene
Elaine Taylor-Klaus & Diane Dempster
Melissa Orlov
and Dr. Peg Dawson (to name a few).
Even more exciting is that we’re working with other world-class ADHD experts to build an online course:
Sales page: https://www.smartcourse.io/aims-online-course
Course Preview: https://courses.smartcourse.io/p/adhd-in-middle-school
that will help parents of kids with ADHD thrive through the notoriously difficult Middle School years.
As you can see, our first course is geared to help parents effectively prepare their kids with ADHD for the transition to middle school, and gain a better understanding of how to foster better relationships with the school and at home (for example we know that parent-child relationships and marriages are severely strained when raising a child with ADHD. The divorce rate is twice as high as for parents of neurotypical kids). See here for a brief intro video on our Kickstarter campaign: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/smart-course/adhd-in-middle-school-free-virtual-summit-smart-course?ref=project_build
We have partnered with Wix and Teachable which are successfully established website development and online course platforms to create our site and host the course. However, we will be looking to build our own collaborative platform on WordPress with the help of a WordPress developer/product team.
While we have several ADHD experts developing much of the course material, we are still looking for help with research, internal operations, design (UI/UX, web, graphic), security, product development, sales, and marketing of the organization.
Some skills of particular interest include:
Full-Stack Developer (HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP required)
UI/UX design, Wix Web Design
WordPress expertise (plugin configuration, administration)
Additional responsibilities :
Collecting product insights through customer discovery
Product management / agile development experience
Customer Service / Customer Support experience
The work will involve helping to develop and manage overall company progress, team and project management, event planning, company strategy, research and data analysis with parents, and/or sharing your knowledge on the subject. Then, depending on the level of contribution, you could get a percentage of the tuition ongoing, make commissions from sales of the course, or the course could be a source of referrals and marketing for your research and, eventually, potentially your own practice.
We are looking for someone to join the team full-time, however, as an early-stage startup we are unable to provide payment at this time and instead are offering a commission, profit-share, and/or equity-based payment plan, which would be determined over a trial period at the company, and can be discussed further in your interview on an individual basis.
We are looking for someone who is passionate about child psychology, mental health, learning disabilities, and attention disorders, who wants to harness the power of technology to improve people’s lives.
Although some experience in human resources, project management, operations management, customer tech support, and agile methodology is desirable, we are looking for enthusiasm, a deep desire to learn, and a commitment to the cause.
Our goals moving forward would be to continue partnering with organizations, influencers, or professionals that speak to parents of kids with ADHD and market Smart Course’s products and resources nationally with the help of a human resources manager / HR assistant, agile project manager, operations manager, and/or customer technical support representative, in order to become the go-to authority for online education in the space.
Some reasons you might be interested:
You want to hone your skills and see how they perform in a business context
You are looking to start your own company, dive into entrepreneurship, or want a fast-tracked career towards an executive position
You want to bring your interests in child development, research, education, or clinical work into a more applied setting and translate it into actions that are directly relevant to families
You want to collect data from parents, practice data analysis skills, and present findings in relevant settings
You want to meet and network with leading professionals in the field (educational psychologists, clinical psychologists, educational specialists, etc.)
You want to get involved in the Education Technology and/or Healthcare Technology / MedTech spaces which are growing exponentially, especially for students with special needs
You’re interested in entrepreneurship, startups, and/or technology and want to put your interests to good use
We’ll be growing very quickly over the next semester and need help from bright people interested in education or startups.

python developer,"New York, NY",Backend Software Engineer,"New York, NY 10002 (Lower East Side area)","Appfigures, Inc.",None,30+ days ago,"Appfigures is a sales and marketing analytics platform for mobile developers. We take the guesswork out of running the business around your apps and we're looking for talented backend developers to help us. You’ll be building new features and improving existing ones used daily by thousands of mobile app developers all around the world. Like every member of the Appfigures team, you'll also be involved in making decisions about product development and user experience.
You & Us:
You have mastered a programming language of your choice. You are likely sick and tired of writing Fizz Buzz. We mainly use C# and Python, but it’s okay if you don’t know them. We think that being a capable developer in one language implies you’d be able to get comfortable with most languages or environments. We are always open to trying new things to figure out what the best tool for the job is and hope you are too.
You have a disciplined approach to development, testing, and quality assurance. We know perfection isn’t possible, but we think about the trade-offs inherent in our designs and guard against them up front. Folks rely on our data to run their businesses, so it’s important that we get it right.
You recognize that sometimes you need to throw away the prototype (and sometimes you need to ship it). We think it’s OK to experiment and we understand that sometimes you don’t know if something will work until you try it. And sometimes that thing you tried just didn’t work.
You can write clean, fast, and efficient code while keeping in mind the bigger context of what we are doing and why. We wouldn’t do this if it weren’t fun, but we know that at the end of the day the software we build is to simplify the lives of our customers.
You’re looking forward to getting to know our users. We rotate escalated support duties across the team. It’s an opportunity for everyone to see how our users interact with the platform, what they need next, and what could be improved.
You’re willing to try new things in a collaborative environment. We’re a small team so responsibilities are flexible. We are a place where initiative beyond the job description is rewarded. We want you to feel empowered to commit or critique in any part of our codebase or company. We want you to feel empowered to take features from an idea all the way to our users. We think every team member’s perspective and opinion is important, and taken together will help make the best product we can.
Pluses:
A BS / MS in Computer Science or related field-- a degree means less to us than proven ability.
Contributions to open source projects, blogs, books, and StackOverflow or work experience.
Experience with the web, the software and hardware behind it, scraping, and performance analysis.
What You Might Be Working On
Integrating a new datasource or API integration to ingest new datasets mobile app developers need to run their businesses.
Scaling a critical scraping service.
Diagnosing and fixing performance issues in our API.
Working with sales, marketing, and others on the product and engineering teams to envision and create new products and features for our users.
Helping the data science team turn ML models into production-grade products.
Benefits
Great medical, dental, and vision insurance
401(k) retirement plan
Pre-tax transit benefits, subsidized gym memberships and excellent discounts on hundreds of other well-known services and products
Plenty of paid time-off and flexible remote work policy
Awesome work station with whatever you need to be happy and productive
A fully stocked kitchen with a variety of snacks and drinks
Monthly personal project days
Weekly catered lunches
Events for employees and members
How To Apply
Please forward a small, self-contained code sample (jobs_backend at appfigures dot com or via indeed messaging). It can be in any language of your choice-- we are more interested in clarity than complexity. A small program you've written or something else you are proud of would be ideal.
If you have a portfolio, source repos, hexdump of a demoscene intro that runs on a microwave, or something similar online already you can just point us in that direction.

You’ll mentor our other developers, helping them level-up to becoming senior developers. You’ll set standards by practice and example, ensuring that the product is well-documented and team decisions are communicated and socialized. Instead of taking on all the hardest and meatiest problems yourself, you’ll make sure your team members are working on problems that will help them grow and assist them as needed. When a problem is encountered, your first thought is, “how can I help someone else solve that” instead of, “it’s fastest to do it myself.” You’ll lead design reviews to ensure that we’re thinking about security, manageability, and maintainability of everything we build.
Who you are:
You have web programming experience in Python and Go-Lang and have used a MVC framework such as Flask or Django.
You practice Test Driven Development with an Agile cadence
You have consumed and created REST APIs and can talk to us about application design patterns involved in building a robust API-based application
You have experience working with a cross-functional team to build and maintain a product
You’re familiar with source control and continuous integration concepts
You have a degree in a technical field like computer science or you have equivalent production release practical experience.

Software Engineer (Mid - Sr.)
San Francisco, CA

At Docker Inc, we believe that containerization will soon become the next big thing, the next tool which will be part of every developer and sysadmin toolbox. What's ""containerization"" The name comes the LXC technology (Linux Containers), and the technique is also known as ""Lightweight Virtualization"".

That's why we recently launched Docker (http://www.docker.io/), an Open Source tool enabling anyone to run those Linux Containers very easily. Containers boot 1000x faster than virtual machines; their disk and memory footprint are also much lower; and they work on virtually all current platforms (from physical servers to public cloud instances). We think that they are the future of virtualization, and will soon become ubiquitous.

Convinced Then fork the repo on github (https://github.com/dotcloud/docker) and have a look at the code. Not convinced Then check the website (http://www.docker.io/), which contains more details, demos, and screencasts. Excited about this Then join our engineering team!

Responsibilities:
being a contributor to the Docker project, which means contributing patches, and reviewing and merging pull requests from the community;
working on Docker’s server-side applications;
participate in product discussions, influence the roadmap, and take ownership and responsibility over new projects to make them happen.
Qualifications:
can read and write Go code (because docker itself is in Go);
can read and write Python code (because many tools and services built around Docker are in Python);
are familiar with network protocols: the lower layers like IP, TCP, and UDP; and the higher layers like HTTP;
have experience in scaling large applications;
have at least a Bachelor degree in Computer Science;
believe that writing unit and functional tests is important.",http://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=05fff5090677899e&fccid=1cbe7d59a6dc275d&vjs=3
